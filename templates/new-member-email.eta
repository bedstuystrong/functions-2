  <p>Welcome to Bed-Stuy Strong. We’re so glad you’re here.</p>

  <h2>Getting started...?</h2>
  <p>
    We've been busy figuring out what the future of Bed-Stuy Strong looks like, and our old welcome guide is <em>super</em> out of date. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The best way to jump in is to join us on Slack, starting with our <a href="https://bedstuystrong.slack.com/canvas/CVAMQEN5T">Slack Directory</a>.<br />
    To get a feel for what's currently happening, keep an eye on the <a href="https://bedstuystrong.slack.com/archives/CVAMQEN5T">#announcements</a> channel 
    and on our <a href="https://instagram.com/bedstuystrong">Instagram</a>.

    We hope to have a new onboarding process figured out soon!
